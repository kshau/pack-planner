                    Backpacking is an adventurous form of travel where individuals carry their essential belongings in a backpack, 
                    allowing them to explore various destinations with freedom and flexibility. 
                    Itâ€™s a popular activity for those who enjoy nature, hiking, and the thrill of self-sufficiency. 
                    To aid backpackers in their preparations, Pack Planner offers a comprehensive solution. 
                    Inspired by <a href="https://lighterpack.com" className="underline">LighterPack</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ultralight/" className="underline">r/Ultralight</a>, 
                    This website enables users to create detailed lists of items needed for their backpacking trips, 
                    providing a seamless way to calculate the total weight and cost of their gear. Additionally, Pack Planner 
                    integrates with online stores, allowing users to search for and add products directly to their lists,
